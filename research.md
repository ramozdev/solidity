# Research on writing smart-contracts

Using Finite State Machines to generate solidity code.

Running tests against smart contracts written in Solidity in not exhaustive, therefore it must not be used as a verification tool to see if the code written by the developer matches the smart contractâ€™s specification. Formal verification offers an exhaustive verification method that either finds a solution to the mathematical models or finds no solution and indicates the portion of the code the failed.

As smart contracts become more complex, state diagrams become more useful. Developers can use them to visualize the specification and write the solidity code.
